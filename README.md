Why the name - 'Skillpur' ?
</h1>
<br>
<p align="center">
The word ‘Skillpur’ when translated from its colloquial form into English means ‘Skills Hub’.
It is often seen that people get scammed when their intentions are in lieu they were just trying to do good for other people, they were trying to extend their help. Again, it is seen that there are some Clubs or NGOs who do not get enough funds to work for humanitarian causes because of the lack of proper representation.
