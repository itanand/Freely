# Skillpur React App Frontend setup guidelines ðŸš€

**Hey contributor, I want you to stick to the below listed Setup guidelines to successfully setup the react app in your local system and get started with developing!!**

<br/>

- `Fork` the repo to your account.
- `git clone` to clone the repo

- Now you have the repo in your **local storage**
- Make sure you have **Node.js** on your local device, click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) & download the **LTS version** of it. 
- Next to setup the *react app* `npm install --force`. Note: I have some dependencies who is not comapible with latest react App. For this reason You have to add --force. If you have React 16.2.0 version you can simply go with Npm react. 
- Once the node modules and other stuffs are installed , `npm run dev` to start the app in `http://localhost:3000/`
- To setup the **backend**, You can refer <a href="https://github.com/itanand/Skillpurb/main/rules/BackendSetup.md">BackendSetup.md</a>
- Make changes **according** to the Tasks assigned to you
- Maintain the folder structure , keep small components like **Navbar, Footer** in `src\components` folder
- Keep big Pages like **Login page, home page** in the `src\pages` folder
- We have used **Bootsrap 5.0** for styling , css files are available in `src\styles`
- You are also allowed to use GOOGLE FONTS for same fonts as of figma files.
- Other extra **Pictures, icons , svgs** are to be kept in `src\assets\`
